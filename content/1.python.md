summary: A\* Pathfinding Algorithm implementation coded up in the python programming language

# Introduction

Python was the first language that I ever learned back in early 2020. I started out with making simple terminal based applications and eventually moved on to making graphical applications with the help of a game making library called [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).

Eventually after furthering my knowledge in said module I moved on to using it to create all sorts of things like algorithm visualizers or GUI's. One thing that caught my fancy was pathfinding. I remember watching Cl√©ment Mihailescu's youtube video on [pathfinding visualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak) and thinking "wow I will never be able to make something like this".

That never eventually fueled me to make the first project I was ever proud of that is an A\* pathfinding algorithm's visualization. The project in question today is just a cleaned up and refactored version of code that I wrote over two years ago.

# Explanation

### Making the board

<!-- <img src="{static}/assets/python/empty-board.png" style="width: 275px" alt="base pathfinding" class="image-medium" align="right" /> -->

The first step before proceeding is to make the main board that we will be using to visualize our algorithm in.

```py
self.screen = pg.display.set_mode(
    (self.row_cells * self.cell_size, self.col_cells * self.cell_size)
)
# draws rows
for x_idx in range(self.row_cells + 1):
    pg.draw.rect(
        self.screen,
        (0, 0, 0),
        pg.Rect(x_idx * self.cell_size, 0, 3, self.col_cells * self.cell_size),
    )
# draws columns
for y_idx in range(self.col_cells + 1):
    pg.draw.rect(
        self.screen,
        (0, 0, 0),
        pg.Rect(0, y_idx * self.cell_size, self.row_cells * self.cell_size, 3),
    )
```

### Making the Node class

Now lets make a `Node` dataclass to house all our nitty gritty nodes stuff

```py
@dataclass
class Node:
    x_pos: int  # x pos on grid
    y_pos: int  # y pos on grid
    g_cost: float = 0  # distance from start node
    h_cost: float = 0  # distance from end node
    f_cost: float = 0  # sum of g_cost and h_cost
    state: str = "idle"  # traversed, idle, blocked, neighbour
    isStartNode: bool = False  # is it the start node
    isEndNode: bool = False  # is it the start node
    parent: Optional[Node] = None  # node originated from
```

### Making the logic

Now that our main backing is ready for the program we can get down to actually programming the algorithm

To begin we first need to understand how the A\* Algorithm actually works! The algorithm consists of three main components

- H cost: which is the distance the current node has from the ending node
- G cost: which it the distance the current node has traveled from the starting node
- F cost: which is the sum of the `H cost` and `G cost`


<center>$f(n) = h(n) + g(n)$</center>


At each iteration of the algorithm we find the node with the lowest `F cost` and add it to a list of closed nodes after marking it as traversed. We stop iteration when our current node becomes equal to the ending node

Here is how the algorithm looks like in pseudo code

**Note: pseudo code copied from wikipedia**

```js
function reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)
    total_path := {current}
    while current in cameFrom.Keys:
        current := cameFrom[current]
        total_path.prepend(current)
    return total_path

function A_Star(start, goal, h)
    openSet := {start}
    cameFrom := an empty map

    gScore := map with default value of Infinity
    gScore[start] := 0

    fScore := map with default value of Infinity
    fScore[start] := h(start)

    while openSet is not empty
        current := the node in openSet having the lowest fScore[] value
        if current = goal
            return reconstruct_path(cameFrom, current)

        openSet.Remove(current)
        for each neighbor of current
            tentative_gScore := gScore[current] + d(current, neighbor)

            if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]
                cameFrom[neighbor] := current
                gScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore
                fScore[neighbor] := tentative_gScore + h(neighbor)
                if neighbor not in openSet
                    openSet.add(neighbor)
    return failure
```

# After thoughts

Python was my first introduction to programming and I have had a wonderful experience learning it. Even after three years of programming in python I learn something new everyday, like fun fact did you know just like the `global` keyword a `local` keyword also exists? Crazy right!

But if I had the power to change something I would prefer python to be more static typed. That need has been fulfilled by static type checkers like [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) but still it would be a nice out of the box feature. The syntax is easy to read and is almost plain english which makes it easy to convert thoughts to code.

I had fun re-visiting old code and looking at the horror that I had programmed a year or so ago. Refactoring it on the other hand was not a fun experience.

I would suggest python to anybody as a great language to start out in since its easier to learn some common CS fundamentals in.
