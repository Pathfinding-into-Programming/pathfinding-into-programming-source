<h1>About The Project</h1>

<strong>Pathfinding into Programming</strong> was a project born to give fuel to my obsession to try out new things, in this case programming languages. Whoever had said that <i>"programming languages aren't pokemon, you don't have to 'learn em all'"</i> surely had never met me before.

The project in based roughly around the concepts of the book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/" class="underline">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a> by Bruce A. Tate as well as The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crk0t5j3icg" class="underline">README Book Club</a>.

The name <strong>pathfinding</strong> came from the fact that I would be programming the <a class='underline' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm'>A* Pathfinding Algorithm</a> in every language that I will be trying to learn the basics about.

Hey my name is <strong>Aditya Jyoti</strong> and I go by the alias of <strong>Toady</strong> on the internet. I began programming in March of 2020 with <a class='underline' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)'>Python</a> but wrote my first official project only later that year.

I have always loved just creating thing, seeing things take life in front of my eyes is the most beautiful thing to me <i>(metaphorically speaking that is, childbirth just seems scary to me)</i>. I have always jumped from one hobby to another be it making <a href="https://soundcloud.com/drcrossbones/back-to-the-future?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing" class="underline">music</a> or making a really nice powerpoint presentation. But I could never stick to just one thing.

Programming seemed to fill that void of consistency in me since its been over two years and I haven't yet lost interest in it.
